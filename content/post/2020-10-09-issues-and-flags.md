**Publishers** share datasets, but also manage data quality.  **GBIF** provides **access** to the use of biodiversity data, but also **flags** suspicious or missing content. **Users** use data, but also clean and remove records. Each play an important role in managing and improving data quality..

## What are GBIF issues and flags?

The GBIF network publishes datasets, integrating them into a common access system. Here users can retrieve data through common search and download services. During the indexation process over the raw data, GBIF adds **issues** and **flags** to records with common data quality problems.

<!--
During **interpretation** GBIF performs additional checks and conversion routines. This **interpretation** is to ensure that data are interoperable and useful.

<!--

* Flags help users to filter or be aware of possible inconsistencies in the data.
* Flags help data providers detect different quality issues that can be fixed in the published dataset/records.

 Write your comments here 

Thinking on how publishers and users can deal with the issues/flags identified by GBIF.org is important to recognize the most common problems that this mechanism can help to improve the data quality:

- Lack in the use of controlled vocabularies (e.g. basisOfRecord)
- Inconsistent data (e.g. country ≠ countryCode)
- Using appropriate standardized formats, like ISO codes (e.g. countryCode, eventDate)
- Using valid values to interpret/index numeric data (e.g. individualCount, coordinateUncertaintyInMeters)
- Values between the correct numeric range laid in the right columns (e.g. elevation/depth swapped)
- Inappropriate use of zero (0) to document empty or missing values (e.g. decimal Lat/Long = 0)
- Using correct characters to build lists (e.g. references, url)

-->

**Excluding all records** with a particular issue is **not** currently possible with the search interface. It is possible to filter all records you are not interested in **with issues** by selecting the particular issue and hitting the **reverse button**. However, reversing will still only give you all other flagged occurrences and **not** issue-free records. This is something that GBIF is working to improve. (at [occurrence search](https://www.gbif.org/occurrence/search))

**Remarks** are shown on the individual occurrence pages to explain the process done after interpretation:

1. **Excluded** means the original data couldn’t be interpreted, so is excluded in the interpreted fields.
2. **Altered** means the original data is modified in the interpretation process to be indexed in GBIF.org.
3. **Inferred** means the Using other record information the data indexed is inferred, if the original is empty.

### For Data providers (“publishers”)

A list of issues & flags is also available for each dataset at the dataset page metrics (e.g. https://www.gbif.org/dataset/4fa7b334-ce0d-4e88-aaae-2e0c138d049e/metrics). This helps publishers to identify what data quality issues to tackle.

## Definitions

More than **50 issues and flags** have been created to deal with common data quality problems. The following **long** section compiles all of them and offers a more clear description of each one. This section is intended to serve as a placeholder until more formal documentation can be written.  

<big>**Geospatial Issues**</big>

- - -

**Zero coordinate** <small>(geospatial)</small> <small>[example](https://www.gbif.org/occurrence/search?issue=ZERO_COORDINATE)</small><br>Coordinates are exactly 0/0, often indicating an actual null coordinate.<br><small>**Terms**: dwc:decimalLatitude, dwc:decimalLongitude</small><br>

**Zero** occurrence records are flagged with the following **geospatial issues** on GBIF as of the writing of this post. 

**Elevation unlikely** <small>(geospatial)</small> <small>[example](https://www.gbif.org/occurrence/search?issue=ELEVATION_UNLIKELY)</small><br>The values for minimum and maximum elevation are above the troposphere (17000 m) or below Mariana Trench (11000 m).<br><small>**Terms**: dwc:minimumElevationInMeters, dwc:maximumElevationInMeters</small><br>

<!-- maybe do not we need deprecated issues -->
<!-- **Coordinate accuracy invalid** <small>(geospatial)</small> <small>[example](https://www.gbif.org/occurrence/search?issue=COORDINATE_ACCURACY_INVALID)</small><br>Deprecated.<br><small>**Terms**: NA</small><br> -->

<br>
<big>**Taxonomic Issues**</big>

- - -

**Taxon match higherrank** <small>(taxonomic)</small> <small>[example](https://www.gbif.org/occurrence/search?issue=TAXON_MATCH_HIGHERRANK)</small><br>The record can be matched to the GBIF taxonomic backbone at a higher rank, but not with the scientific name given.<br><small>**Terms**: dwc:scientificName,dwc:kingdom,dwc:phylum, dwc:class, dwc:order, dwc:family, dwc:genus, dwc:subgenus, dwc:specificEpithet, dwc:infraspecificEpithet, dwc:taxonRank</small><br><br> 
Reasons include:<br/>- The name is new, and not available in the taxonomic datasets yet<br/>- The name is missing in the backbone's taxonomic sources for others reasons<br/>- Formatting or spelling of the scientific name caused interpretation errors

**Taxon match none** <small>(taxonomic)</small> <small>[example](https://www.gbif.org/occurrence/search?issue=TAXON_MATCH_NONE)</small><br>Matching to the taxonomic backbone cannot be done cause there was no match at all or several matches with too little information to keep them apart (homonyms).<br><small>**Terms**: dwc:scientificName,dwc:kingdom,dwc:phylum, dwc:class, dwc:order, dwc:family, dwc:genus, dwc:subgenus, dwc:specificEpithet, dwc:infraspecificEpithet, dwc:taxonRank</small><br>

[**Edit** 2023-09-21 New flags added]

**Scientific name and ID inconsistent** <small>(taxonomic)</small> <small>[example](https://www.gbif.org/occurrence/search?issue=SCIENTIFIC_NAME_AND_ID_INCONSISTENT)</small><br>The scientificName provided in the occurrence record does not precisely match the name in the registered checklist when using the scientificNameID, taxonID or taxonConceptID to look it up. Publishers are advised to check the IDs are correct, or update the formatting of the names on their records.<br><small>**Terms**: dwc:scientificName,dwc:scientificNameID,dwc:taxonID,dwc:taxonConceptID</small><br>

**Taxon match name and ID ambiguous** <small>(taxonomic)</small> <small>[example](https://www.gbif.org/occurrence/search?issue=TAXON_MATCH_NAME_AND_ID_AMBIGUOUS)</small><br>The GBIF Backbone concept was found using the scientificNameID, taxonID or taxonConceptID, but it differs from what would have been found if the classification names on the record were used. This may indicate a gap in the GBIF backbone, a poor mapping between the checklist and the backbone, or a mismatch between the classification names and the declared IDs (scientificNameID or taxonConceptID) on the occurrence record itself.<br><small>**Terms**: dwc:scientificName,dwc:scientificNameID,dwc:taxonID,dwc:taxonConceptID</small><br>

**Scientific name ID not found** <small>(taxonomic)</small> <small>[example](https://www.gbif.org/occurrence/search?issue=SCIENTIFIC_NAME_ID_NOT_FOUND)</small><br>The scientificNameID matched a known pattern, but it was not found in the associated checklist. The backbone lookup was performed using either the names or a different ID field from the record. This may indicate a poorly formatted identifier or may be caused by a newly created ID that isn't yet known in the version of the published checklist.<br><small>**Terms**: dwc:scientificNameID</small><br>

**Taxon concept ID not found** <small>(taxonomic)</small> <small>[example](https://www.gbif.org/occurrence/search?issue=TAXON_CONCEPT_ID_NOT_FOUND)</small><br>The taxonConceptID matched a known pattern, but it was not found in the associated checklist. The backbone lookup was performed using either the names or a different ID field from the record. This may indicate a poorly formatted identifier or may be caused by a newly created ID that isn't yet known in the version of the published checklist.<br><small>**Terms**: dwc:taxonConceptID</small><br>

**Taxon ID not found** <small>(taxonomic)</small> <small>[example](https://www.gbif.org/occurrence/search?issue=TAXON_ID_NOT_FOUND)</small><br>The  taxonID found matched a known pattern, but it was not found in the associated checklist. The backbone lookup was performed using either the names or a different ID field from the record. This may indicate a poorly formatted identifier or may be caused by a newly created ID that isn't yet known in the version of the published checklist.<br><small>**Terms**: dwc:taxonID</small><br>

**Taxon match scientific name ID ignored** <small>(taxonomic)</small> <small>[example](https://www.gbif.org/occurrence/search?issue=TAXON_MATCH_SCIENTIFIC_NAME_ID_IGNORED)</small><br>The scientificNameID was not used when mapping the record to the GBIF backbone. This may indicate one of: (1) The ID uses a pattern not configured for use by GBIF (2) The ID did not uniquely identify a concept in the checklist (3) The ID found a concept in the checklist that did not map to the backbone (4) A different ID was used, or the record names were used, as no ID lookup successfully linked to the backbone<br><small>**Terms**: dwc:scientificNameID</small><br>

**Taxon match taxon concept ID ignored** <small>(taxonomic)</small> <small>[example](https://www.gbif.org/occurrence/search?issue=TAXON_MATCH_TAXON_CONCEPT_ID_IGNORED)</small><br>The taxonConceptID was not used when mapping the record to the GBIF backbone.

## Checklists issues and flags [Edit from 2023-01-19]

The GBIF system also flags taxon records coming from checklists. You can search and select checklist records by flags in our [Species search interface](https://www.gbif.org/species/search?advanced=1):

**Could not be matched to GBIF backbone** <small>(checklist)</small> <small>[example](https://www.gbif.org/species/search?issue=BACKBONE_MATCH_NONE&advanced=1)</small><br>The interpretation of the taxonomic name could not find an existing equivalent, or near-enough match, in the GBIF taxonomic backbone. If the taxon name is newly described or a recent recombination, this is expected, until the new name can be integrated into the backbone taxonomy. You can check how a scientific name is matched against the backbone taxonomy using our species name matching tool: https://www.gbif.org/tools/species-lookup<br><small>**Terms**: [dwc:scientificName](https://dwc.tdwg.org/list/#dwc_scientificName)</small><br>

**Synonym lacking an accepted name** <small>(checklist)</small> <small>[example](https://www.gbif.org/species/search?issue=ACCEPTED_NAME_MISSING&advanced=1)</small><br>The taxon name is explicitly marked as a synonym, but lacking a reference to the corresponding accepted name. If the accepted name is contained in the same data source, consider adding a reference to it.<br><small>**Terms**: [dwc:TaxonomicStatus](https://dwc.tdwg.org/list/#dwc_taxonomicStatus), [dwc:acceptedNameUsageID](https://dwc.tdwg.org/list/#dwc_acceptedNameUsageID)</small><br>


**Accepted name not unique** <small>(checklist)</small> <small>[example](https://www.gbif.org/species/search?issue=ACCEPTED_NAME_NOT_UNIQUE&advanced=1)</small><br>The synonym record provides the accepted name as verbatim text, rather than as a cross-reference. The verbatim name is ambiguous and could refer to several different records in GBIF's backbone taxonomy.<br><small>**Terms**: [dwc:acceptedNameUsage](https://dwc.tdwg.org/list/#dwc_acceptedNameUsage)</small><br>


**Parent name not unique** <small>(checklist)</small> <small>[example](https://www.gbif.org/species/search?issue=PARENT_NAME_NOT_UNIQUE&advanced=1)</small><br>The record provides the name of the taxonomic parent as verbatim text, rather than as a cross-reference. The verbatim name is ambiguous and could refer to several different records in GBIF's backbone taxonomy.<br><small>**Terms**: [dwc:parentNameUsage](https://dwc.tdwg.org/list/#dwc_parentNameUsage)</small><br>


**Original name not unique** <small>(checklist)</small> <small>[example](https://www.gbif.org/species/search?issue=ORIGINAL_NAME_NOT_UNIQUE&advanced=1)</small><br>The record provides the original name of the taxon (e.g. basionym) as verbatim text, rather than as a cross-reference. The verbatim name is ambiguous and could refer to several different records in GBIF's backbone taxonomy.<br><small>**Terms**: [dwc:originalNameUsage](https://dwc.tdwg.org/list/#dwc_originalNameUsage)</small><br>


**Relationship missing** <small>(checklist)</small> <small>[example](https://www.gbif.org/species/search?issue=RELATIONSHIP_MISSING&advanced=1)</small><br>There were problems representing all name relationships, i.e. the link to the parent, accepted and/or original name. The interpreted record in GBIF is lacking some of the original source relation.<br><small>**Terms**: [dwc:originalNameUsage](https://dwc.tdwg.org/list/#dwc_originalNameUsage), [dwc:parentNameUsage](https://dwc.tdwg.org/list/#dwc_parentNameUsage), [dwc:acceptedNameUsage](https://dwc.tdwg.org/list/#dwc_acceptedNameUsage), [dwc:acceptedNameUsageID](https://dwc.tdwg.org/list/#dwc_acceptedNameUsageID), [dwc:TaxonomicStatus](https://dwc.tdwg.org/list/#dwc_taxonomicStatus), [dwc:parentNameUsageID](https://dwc.tdwg.org/list/#dwc_parentNameUsageID)</small><br>


**Basionym relation derived** <small>(GBIF backbone)</small> <small>[example](https://www.gbif.org/species/search?issue=ORIGINAL_NAME_DERIVED&advanced=1)</small><br>The record in GBIF has a relationship to an original name (basionym) that was derived from name & authorship comparison, but did not exist explicitly in the source data. This will only be flagged in programmatically generated GBIF backbone records of name usages. GBIF backbone specific issue.


**Conflicting basionym combination** <small>(GBIF backbone)</small> <small>[example](https://www.gbif.org/species/search?issue=CONFLICTING_BASIONYM_COMBINATION&advanced=1)</small><br>There have been more than one accepted name in a homotypical basionym group of names. GBIF backbone specific issue.<br><small>**Terms**: [dwc:scientificName](https://dwc.tdwg.org/list/#dwc_scientificName)</small><br>


**No species included** <small>(GBIF backbone)</small> <small>[example](https://www.gbif.org/species/search?issue=NO_SPECIES&advanced=1)</small><br>The group (currently only genera are tested) is lacking any accepted species. GBIF backbone specific issue.


**Name parent mismatch** <small>(GBIF backbone)</small> <small>[example](https://www.gbif.org/species/search?issue=NAME_PARENT_MISMATCH&advanced=1)</small><br>The (accepted) bi/trinomial name does not match the parent name and should be recombined into the parent genus/species. For example the species _Picea alba_ with a parent genus _Abies_ is a mismatch, and should be replaced by _Abies alba_. GBIF backbone specific issue.


**Orthographic variant** <small>(GBIF backbone)</small> <small>[example](https://www.gbif.org/species/search?issue=ORTHOGRAPHIC_VARIANT&advanced=1)</small><br>An entry in the backbone is suspected to be only a spelling variation of an otherwise existing name. GBIF backbone specific issue.


**Homonym** <small>(GBIF backbone)</small> <small>[example](https://www.gbif.org/species/search?issue=HOMONYM&advanced=1)</small><br>A not synonymized homonym exists for this name in some other backbone source which have been ignored at build time. GBIF backbone specific issue.
<!--- 
TODO: Need a better explanation. Why not-synonymized, and ignored? What does it mean to a user? I would have assumed this flag to notify users that a homonym (identical name but different authorship) does exist that describes an unrelated group of organisms (taxon).
--->

**Published earlier than parent name** <small>(GBIF backbone)</small> <small>[example](https://www.gbif.org/species/search?issue=PUBLISHED_BEFORE_GENUS&advanced=1)</small><br>A bi/trinomial name was seemingly published earlier than the parent genus/species. This might indicate a homonym issue, or that the name should rather be a recombination. GBIF backbone specific issue.
