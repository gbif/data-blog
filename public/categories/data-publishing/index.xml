      <description>Since 2022, GBIF has been monitoring changes of occurrenceIDs in datasets to improve the stability of GBIF identifiers. We pause data ingestion when we detect more than half of occurrence records in the latest version have different occurrenceIDs from the previous version (live on GBIF.org). This identifier validation process automatically creates issues on GitHub and GBIF helpdesk will contact the publishers to verify the changes of occurrenceIDs.
Our aim in this process is to minimize the changes of GBIF identifiers and to support the needs for citations and data linking.</description>

      <description>When data publishers publish checklists, they will use a a Darwin Core Archive Taxon Core. And although the taxon core terms are already described here, what exactly to put in which field can sometimes be confusing. And there is a lot to read, like here https://github.com/tdwg/tnc/issues/1
Here I am sharing a summary of an email conversation we had with some data publishers on Helpdesk concerning some of the Taxon Core fields.</description>
