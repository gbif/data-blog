      <title>Making collection content discoverable when you donâ€™t have occurrences published on GBIF</title>

      <description>This blog post is a tutorial on how to upload collection descriptors in the Global Registry of Scientific Collections (GRSciColl).
If you are someone working with a physical collection or work with people who do, you might be interested in making these collections findable. Ideally, the content of these collections would be digitized and made available online on relevant platforms like GBIF.org, iDigBio.org, ALA.org.au, etc. Sharing digital specimen records is a great way to ensure the discoverability of collection content.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;You are a data publisher of occurrence data through GBIF.org, care about your data quality, and wonder what to do about the issue flags that show up on your occurrences. You might have noticed a new type flag this year relating to collection and institution codes and identifiers. They are the result of our attempt at linking specimens records to &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.gbif.org/grscicoll&#34;&gt;our Registry of Scientific Collections (GRSciColl)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>As you probably already know, GBIF.org doesn&amp;rsquo;t host any data. The system relies on each data provider making their data available online in a GBIF-supported format. It also relies on organization letting GBIF know where to find these data (in other words registering the data). But how to do just that?
The good news is that there are several GBIF-compatible systems. They will export or make available the data for you in the correct format and several provide means to register them as datasets on GBIF.</description>

      <description>If you are a (first time) publisher on GBIF and you are trying to decide which type of dataset would best fit your data, this blogpost is for you.
All the records shared on GBIF are organized into datasets. Each dataset is associated with some metadata describing its content (the classic &amp;ldquo;what, where, when, why, how&amp;rdquo;). The dataset&amp;rsquo;s content depends strongly on the dataset&amp;rsquo;s class. GBIF currently support four types of dataset:</description>
