      <title>Making collection content discoverable when you don’t have occurrences published on GBIF</title>
      <link>https://data-blog.gbif.org/post/grscicoll-collection-descriptors/</link>

      <description>This blog post is a tutorial on how to upload collection descriptors in the Global Registry of Scientific Collections (GRSciColl).
If you are someone working with a physical collection or work with people who do, you might be interested in making these collections findable. Ideally, the content of these collections would be digitized and made available online on relevant platforms like GBIF.org, iDigBio.org, ALA.org.au, etc. Sharing digital specimen records is a great way to ensure the discoverability of collection content.</description>

      <description>When data publishers publish checklists, they will use a a Darwin Core Archive Taxon Core. And although the taxon core terms are already described here, what exactly to put in which field can sometimes be confusing. And there is a lot to read, like here https://github.com/tdwg/tnc/issues/1
Here I am sharing a summary of an email conversation we had with some data publishers on Helpdesk concerning some of the Taxon Core fields.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;You are a data publisher of occurrence data through GBIF.org, care about your data quality, and wonder what to do about the issue flags that show up on your occurrences. You might have noticed a new type flag this year relating to collection and institution codes and identifiers. They are the result of our attempt at linking specimens records to &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.gbif.org/grscicoll&#34;&gt;our Registry of Scientific Collections (GRSciColl)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>The Global Registry of Scientific Collections, also known as GRSciColl, has been available on GBIF.org since 2019 but it recently got some more attention when we connected it to GBIF occurrences. Now is the perfect time to share a bit of GRSciColl history and what we plan for its future.
A brief history of GRSciColl First of all, here are a few facts about GrSciColl today, at the start of 2021:</description>

      <title>(Almost) everything you want to know about the GBIF Species API</title>
      <link>https://data-blog.gbif.org/post/gbif-species-api/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today, we are talking about the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.gbif.org/developer/species&#34;&gt;GBIF Species API&lt;/a&gt;. Although you might not use it directly, you probably encountered it while using the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.gbif.org/&#34;&gt;GBIF web portal&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Typing a scientific name in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.gbif.org/occurrence/search?occurrence_status=present&amp;amp;q=&#34;&gt;GBIF Occurrence search&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Seeing a &amp;ldquo;Taxon Match Fuzzy&amp;rdquo; flag.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Using the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.gbif.org/tools/species-lookup&#34;&gt;Species Name matching tool&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This API is what allow us to navigate through the names available on GBIF. I will try to avoid repeating what you can already find in &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.gbif.org/developer/species&#34;&gt;its documentation&lt;/a&gt;. Instead, I will attempt to give an overview and answer some questions that we received in the past.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Which tools can I use to share my data on GBIF?</title>

      <description>As you probably already know, GBIF.org doesn&amp;rsquo;t host any data. The system relies on each data provider making their data available online in a GBIF-supported format. It also relies on organization letting GBIF know where to find these data (in other words registering the data). But how to do just that?
The good news is that there are several GBIF-compatible systems. They will export or make available the data for you in the correct format and several provide means to register them as datasets on GBIF.</description>

      <title>How to choose a dataset class on GBIF?</title>
      <link>https://data-blog.gbif.org/post/choose-dataset-type/</link>

      <description>If you are a (first time) publisher on GBIF and you are trying to decide which type of dataset would best fit your data, this blogpost is for you.
All the records shared on GBIF are organized into datasets. Each dataset is associated with some metadata describing its content (the classic &amp;ldquo;what, where, when, why, how&amp;rdquo;). The dataset&amp;rsquo;s content depends strongly on the dataset&amp;rsquo;s class. GBIF currently support four types of dataset:</description>

      <title>Six questions answered about the GBIF Backbone Taxonomy</title>
      <link>https://data-blog.gbif.org/post/gbif-backbone-taxonomy/</link>

      <guid>https://data-blog.gbif.org/post/gbif-backbone-taxonomy/</guid>
      <description>This past week our informatics team has been updating the Backbone taxonomy on GBIF.org. This is a fairly disruptive process which sometimes involves massive taxonomic changes but DON’T PANIC.
This update is a good thing. It means that some of the taxonomic issues reported have been addressed (see for example this issue concerning the Xylophagidae family) and that new species are now visible on GBIF. Plus, it gives me an excellent opportunity to talk about the GBIF backbone taxonomy and answer some of the questions you might have.</description>

      <title>Sequenced-based data on GBIF - What you need to know before analyzing data</title>
      <link>https://data-blog.gbif.org/post/gbif-molecular-data-quality/</link>

      <guid>https://data-blog.gbif.org/post/gbif-molecular-data-quality/</guid>
      <description>As I mentioned in my previous post, a lot more sequence-based data has been made available on GBIF this past year. MGnify alone, published 295 datasets for a total of 13,285,109 occurrences. Even though most of these occurrences are Bacteria or Chromista, more than a million of them are animals and more than 300,000 are plants. So chances are, that even if you are not interested in bacteria, you might encounter sequence-based data on GBIF.</description>

      <title>Sequence-based data on GBIF - Sharing your data</title>
      <link>https://data-blog.gbif.org/post/gbif-molecular-data/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;[Edit 2021-09-16]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Important&lt;/strong&gt;: To find guidance on how to publish Sequence-based data on GBIF, please consult the following guide:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andersson AF, Bissett A, Finstad AG, Fossøy F, Grosjean M, Hope M, Jeppesen TS, Kõljalg U, Lundin D, Nilsson RN, Prager M, Svenningsen C &amp;amp; Schigel D (2020) Publishing DNA-derived data through biodiversity data platforms. v1.0 Copenhagen: GBIF Secretariat. &lt;a href=&#34;https://doi.org/10.35035/doc-vf1a-nr22&#34;&gt;https://doi.org/10.35035/doc-vf1a-nr22&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[End edit 2021-09-16]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GBIF is trying to make it easier to share sequence-based data. In fact, this past year alone, we worked with &lt;a href=&#34;https://unite.ut.ee&#34;&gt;UNITE&lt;/a&gt; to integrate species hypothesis for fungi and with EMBL-&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ebi.ac.uk&#34;&gt;EBI&lt;/a&gt; to publish 295 metagenomics datasets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, documentation is not as quick to follow. Although we have now an &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.gbif.org/faq?question=how-can-i-publish-molecular-data-to-gbif&#34;&gt;FAQ&lt;/a&gt; on the topic, I thought that anyone could use a blog post with some advice and examples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that this blog post is not intended to be documentation. The information written is subject to change, feel free to leave comments if you have any question or suggestion.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>This blog post covers the publication of multimedia on GBIF. However, it is not intended to be documentation. For more information, please check the references below.
NB: GBIF does not host original multimedia files and there is no way to upload pictures to the platform. For more information, please read the how to publish paragraphs.
Media displayed on the GBIF portal Let&amp;rsquo;s say that you are looking for pictures of otters, or perhaps the call of a sea eagle.</description>

      <title>Finding citizen science datasets on GBIF</title>
      <link>https://data-blog.gbif.org/post/gbif-citizen-science/</link>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;can-we-automatically-label-citizen-science-datasets&#34;&gt;Can we automatically label citizen science datasets?&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The short answer is yes, partially.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-label-gbif-datasets-as-citizen-science&#34;&gt;Why label GBIF datasets as &amp;ldquo;citizen science&amp;rdquo;?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-is-citizen-science&#34;&gt;What is citizen science?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Citizen science is scientific research conducted, in whole or in part, by amateur (or non-professional) scientists. Citizen science is sometimes described as &amp;ldquo;public participation in scientific research,&amp;rdquo; participatory monitoring, and participatory action research (&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizen_science&#34;&gt;wikipedia definition&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;</description>
