      <p>As the business and financial sectors increasingly look towards integrating biodiversity within their sustainability frameworks, this overview outlines the different frameworks that exist, the sectors they belong to, and how the <strong>GBIF infrastructure</strong> and the <strong>data it provides</strong> can support these sectors.</p>
<img src="tree.png" alt="Corporate sustainability frameworks and biodiversity data" width="400">
<p>It is important to say upfront how <strong>GBIF-mediated data</strong> fits within the wider biodiversity data landscape in order to prevent confusion on what one can, and cannot, do with the data. GBIF-mediated data provides records of <strong>where and when species have been observed or collected</strong> from data-holding organizations across the globe.</p>
<p>At a minimum, data will have:</p>
<ul>
<li>a <strong>species name</strong> (Latin binomial),</li>
<li>a <strong>timestamp</strong> of when the observation occurred, and</li>
<li><strong>location information</strong> (often latitude–longitude coordinates).</li>
</ul>
<p>Although not limited to these, other information from the time of collection or observation can also be shared. GBIF is the <strong>world’s largest aggregator</strong> of such data and is used as the basis for derived information products that support biodiversity disclosures such as <strong>ecological niche models</strong> and <strong>Red Lists</strong>.</p>
<p>The reliability of such derived products is directly correlated to the availability of GBIF-mediated data, and GBIF-mediated data can be seen as a <strong>complementary data source</strong> for ground-truthing these derived products.</p>
<h2 id="safeguard-frameworks">Safeguard Frameworks</h2>
<p><strong>Multilateral Development Banks (MDBs)</strong> employ environmental and social safeguard frameworks for their financed projects—both public and private. Projects must demonstrate how they plan to mitigate environmental and social impacts of their activities.</p>
<p>In the case of biodiversity, MDB standards typically require clients to follow the <strong>mitigation hierarchy</strong> when implementing projects:<br>
<strong>Avoid → Minimise → Restore → Offset.</strong></p>
<p>These standards also compel financiers to fund projects that:</p>
<ul>
<li>reduce biodiversity impacts, or</li>
<li>commit to <em>no net loss in natural habitat</em> or <em>net gain in critical habitat.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Below is a list of some commonly used safeguard frameworks used by MDBs:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Level</th>
<th>Institution / Framework</th>
<th>Who It Applies To</th>
<th>Scope &amp; Instruments</th>
<th>Safeguard / Framework</th>
<th>Biodiversity Expectations</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Project-level finance (public)</td>
<td><strong>World Bank (IBRD/IDA)</strong></td>
<td>Governments (sovereign borrowers, public projects)</td>
<td>Loans, grants, guarantees</td>
<td>Environmental &amp; Social Framework (ESF) → Financed projects must meet 10 ESS*</td>
<td><strong>ESS6</strong> - Avoid/minimize biodiversity impacts, sustainable natural resource use; use of offsets less prescriptive; relies on national systems</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Project-level finance (private)</td>
<td><strong>IFC (International Finance Corporation)</strong></td>
<td>Private companies, PPPs, private equity funds, banks</td>
<td>Loans, equity, advisory, syndicated finance</td>
<td>IFC Performance Standards (PSs) → Financed projects must meet 8 PSs (last update, 2012)</td>
<td><strong>PS6</strong> - Strong mitigation hierarchy; no net loss in natural habitats, net gain in critical habitats</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Regional project-level (public &amp; private)**</td>
<td><strong>EBRD (European Bank for Reconstruction and Development)</strong></td>
<td>Private and public clients in EBRD region (Eastern Europe, Central Asia, Southern and Eastern Mediterranean, Northern Africa, Sub-Saharan Africa)</td>
<td>Loans, equity, bonds, guarantees, syndicated finance</td>
<td>EBRD 10 Environmental and Social Requirements (PRs) → Financed projects must meet 10 ESRs</td>
<td><strong>ESR6</strong> - reviewed in 2024; similar to but more up to date than IFC PS6; plus EU law compliance (Habitats/Birds Directives, Natura 2000); strict on protected areas</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>*Environmental and Social Standards<br>
**Other regional major MDB Safeguard Frameworks include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>ADB</strong> (Asian Development Bank): Safeguard Policy Statement (updated 2024)</li>
<li><strong>AfDB</strong> (African Development Bank): Integrated Safeguards System (5 Operational Safeguards)</li>
<li><strong>IDB</strong> (Inter-American Development Bank): Environmental and Social Policy Framework (2021, aligned with IFC PSs)</li>
<li><strong>IsDB</strong> (Islamic Development Bank): Environmental &amp; Social Framework</li>
<li><strong>EIB</strong> (European Investment Bank): Environmental and Social Standards (10 standards, EU-aligned)</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, these MDB safeguard frameworks are extended into:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Commercial banking</strong> via the voluntary <em>Equator Principles</em>, which require borrowers to apply IFC Performance Standards (e.g., PS6).</li>
<li><strong>Export credit agencies</strong> of OECD countries through <em>OECD Common Approaches</em>, which encourage benchmarking against IFC/WB standards (though biodiversity safeguards are less prescriptive).</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="how-financial-institutions-vet-projects">How Financial Institutions Vet Projects</h3>
<p>Below is an outline of an idealised evaluation process outlining opportunities for GBIF-mediated data to support financial institutions in making appropriate investment decisions.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Step</th>
<th>Process</th>
<th>Role of GBIF</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>Screening &amp; Categorization</strong></td>
<td>Bank assigns a risk category (A/B/C, or High/Medium/Low) based on environmental &amp; social risk, which determines the level of safeguard requirements. <br>Example: WB: High risk → full ESIA; IFC: Category A → significant biodiversity/habitat risks.</td>
<td>GBIF-mediated data can provide known presences (and, in some cases, absences) of species, including those of conservation importance (e.g., threatened or invasive species) at the proposed project.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Environmental &amp; Social Impact Assessment (ESIA)</strong></td>
<td>The borrower must prepare an ESIA identifying biodiversity, habitat, and ecosystem impacts and proposing mitigation following the mitigation hierarchy.</td>
<td>GBIF-mediated data can help assess the <em>state of nature before the project</em>, providing known species occurrences, including those of conservation importance, to support “no net loss” or “net gain” goals. Baseline data collected should be shared publicly.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Safeguard Action Plans</strong></td>
<td>If risks are found, banks require Environmental and Social Management Plans (ESMPs) or Biodiversity Action Plans (BAPs) with mitigation commitments.</td>
<td>GBIF-mediated data can help design biodiversity indicators for monitoring “no net loss” or “net gain” by identifying where and what needs monitoring. Publishing monitoring data via GBIF facilitates compliance checks.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Loan/Investment Conditions</strong></td>
<td>Safeguard compliance is written into the loan or investment contract. Failure to comply can lead to suspension or cancellation.</td>
<td>GBIF-mediated data can provide evidence that clients are meeting biodiversity-related loan stipulations.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Independent Review &amp; Due Diligence</strong></td>
<td>Independent check of borrower’s studies.</td>
<td>Independent datasets like GBIF reduce reliance on consultant-provided, opaque data.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Monitoring &amp; Supervision</strong></td>
<td>Borrowers must report regularly; banks may conduct audits, site visits, or consultations.</td>
<td>Borrowers can share monitoring data through GBIF to facilitate audits and adaptive management.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Grievance Mechanisms</strong></td>
<td>Banks (e.g., WB Inspection Panel, IFC&rsquo;s CAO, EBRD&rsquo;s IPAM) allow affected communities or NGOs to file complaints.</td>
<td>GBIF can provide a data source for validating claims, especially when project data is shared through it.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> To achieve <em>no net loss in natural habitats</em> and <em>net gains in critical habitats</em>, clients must assess the <strong>biodiversity baseline</strong> in the area to be affected by the project (EAAA).<br>
That baseline assessment produces invaluable biodiversity data that should be <strong>publicly shared</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="environmental-social-and-governance-esg-frameworks">Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) Frameworks</h2>
<p>MDB safeguard mechanisms ensure biodiversity is considered in project financing. Parallel to these, <strong>business ESG frameworks</strong> guide corporate sustainability performance.</p>
<h3 id="disclosure-frameworks">Disclosure Frameworks</h3>
<p>Disclosure frameworks set standards on how companies should report on specific ESG issues.</p>
<p>The <strong>Taskforce for Nature-related Financial Disclosure (TNFD)</strong> develops the biodiversity component of these frameworks, building on the <strong>Taskforce for Climate-related Financial Disclosure (TCFD)</strong>.</p>
<p>TNFD ensures that <strong>biodiversity dependencies and impacts</strong> are disclosed in a standardised manner across sectors. While voluntary, ESG disclosures are typically made through:</p>
<ul>
<li>Company <strong>annual or ESG reports</strong> (e.g. <a href="https://www.nestle.com/sustainability">Nestlé&rsquo;s Sustainability Report</a>)</li>
<li><strong>Voluntary platforms</strong>, e.g., <a href="https://www.cdp.net/en">Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP)</a>, <a href="https://www.globalreporting.org/">Global Reporting Initiative (GRI)</a></li>
<li><strong>Regulatory filings</strong>, e.g., under EU&rsquo;s Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD)</li>
<li><strong>Best practice requirements</strong>, e.g., as required by EBRD in its <a href="https://www.ebrd.com/home/news-and-events/publications/institutional-documents/environmental-and-social-policy-2024.html">2024 Environmental and Social Policy (including the ESR6 Guidance Note)</a> and described in the <a href="https://www.ebrd.com/content/dam/ebrd_dxp/assets/pdfs/environment---sustainability/implement-performance-requirements/prs/pr6/Technical-guidance-on-uploading-biodiversity-data.pdf">technical guidance on uploading biodiversity data</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Below is an example of regulatory frameworks in different jurisdictions:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Jurisdiction</th>
<th>Framework / Scope</th>
<th>Status of Disclosures</th>
<th>Who Must Comply</th>
<th>Filing / Regulator</th>
</tr>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>UK</strong></td>
<td>TCFD-aligned climate disclosure (mandatory since 2022)</td>

<h3 id="science-based-targets-and-the-tnfd">Science-Based Targets and the TNFD</h3>
<p>Through the TNFD, companies are encouraged to adopt <strong>Science Based Targets for Nature (SBTN)</strong> to set <strong>measurable, science-based biodiversity goals</strong>, e.g.:</p>
<ul>
<li>restore <em>X</em> hectares,</li>
<li>reduce water withdrawal by <em>Y%</em>, or</li>
<li>eliminate deforestation from supply chains.</li>
</ul>
<p>SBTN aligns with the <strong>Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework</strong> and complements TNFD by helping companies <em>set internal goals (SBTN)</em> and <em>disclose them externally (TNFD).</em></p>
<h2 id="how-gbif-supports-business-biodiversity-disclosures">How GBIF Supports Business Biodiversity Disclosures</h2>
<p>Many of the uses of GBIF listed for safeguards apply equally to corporate disclosures:</p>
<h3 id="screening">Screening</h3>
<p>The spatial–temporal nature of GBIF data allows companies to determine known species presences (and, in some cases, absences), including species of conservation importance.<br>
This enables biodiversity baseline assessments across a company’s operations, helping to <strong>avoid and minimise biodiversity impacts</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="biodiversity-monitoring">Biodiversity Monitoring</h3>
<p>Using data coverage and availability over a company’s footprint, companies can design monitoring systems to <strong>measure biodiversity impact</strong> over time and <strong>track progress</strong> towards targets.</p>
<h3 id="data-access">Data Access</h3>
<p>GBIF provides the infrastructure through which <strong>species occurrence data</strong> used in company assessments can be shared.<br>
While not all required data will be found in GBIF, additional company-collected data can be <strong>published through GBIF</strong>, increasing <strong>transparency</strong> and supporting the broader data ecosystem.</p>
<h2 id="gbif-recommendations-to-improve-biodiversity-disclosure-reporting">GBIF Recommendations to Improve Biodiversity Disclosure Reporting</h2>
<p>It is encouraging that businesses recognise GBIF as a data source and infrastructure for sharing species occurrence data. To strengthen the link between business biodiversity reporting and the GBIF infrastructure, we recommend:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Transparency across all biodiversity disclosures</strong><br>
Biodiversity disclosures should be traceable, with sources and data clearly cited. The issuing of <strong>DOIs</strong> by GBIF provides a mechanism for traceability.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Companies should acknowledge data gaps and set collection targets</strong><br>
Address <strong>taxonomic, spatial, and temporal biases</strong> in occurrence data through targeted collection efforts. Companies can help fill data gaps that support robust science and contribute to <strong>Target 21</strong> of the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework.<br>
GBIF <strong>nodes</strong> should build capacity to support company data sharing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Adherence to data licensing</strong><br>
Though GBIF data is freely available, downstream users must <strong>adhere to GBIF data licences</strong> and respect attribution and reuse conditions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Capacity building within companies</strong><br>
Strengthen internal capacity to <strong>use and interpret GBIF-mediated data</strong> and understand its limitations to ensure responsible use in biodiversity reporting.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Accessible, standardised reports</strong><br>
Biodiversity disclosure reports should be <strong>machine-readable</strong> (e.g., digital XML/JSON/CSV) and accessible through open repositories (e.g., <strong>Zenodo</strong>)—as mandated under frameworks like <strong>CSRD</strong>—to ensure public access to underlying data.</p>
</li>
</ol>
