      <title>GBIF attempts to improve identifier stability by monitoring changes of occurrenceIDs</title>

      <description>Since 2022, GBIF has been monitoring changes of occurrenceIDs in datasets to improve the stability of GBIF identifiers. We pause data ingestion when we detect more than half of occurrence records in the latest version have different occurrenceIDs from the previous version (live on GBIF.org). This identifier validation process automatically creates issues on GitHub and GBIF helpdesk will contact the publishers to verify the changes of occurrenceIDs.
Our aim in this process is to minimize the changes of GBIF identifiers and to support the needs for citations and data linking.</description>

      <description>Many data users may suspect theyâ€™ve discovered duplicated records in the GBIF index. You download data from GBIF, analyze them and realize that some records have the same date, scientific name, catalogue number and location but come from two different publishers or have slightly different attributes.
There are many valid reasons why these duplicates appear on GBIF. Sometimes an observation was recorded in two different systems, sometimes several records correspond to herbaria duplicates (you can check the work of Nicky Nicolson on the topic), sometimes a specimen was digitized twice, sometimes a record has been enriched with genetic information and republished via a different platform&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;You are a data publisher of occurrence data through GBIF.org, care about your data quality, and wonder what to do about the issue flags that show up on your occurrences. You might have noticed a new type flag this year relating to collection and institution codes and identifiers. They are the result of our attempt at linking specimens records to &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.gbif.org/grscicoll&#34;&gt;our Registry of Scientific Collections (GRSciColl)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>How to choose a dataset class on GBIF?</title>

      <description>If you are a (first time) publisher on GBIF and you are trying to decide which type of dataset would best fit your data, this blogpost is for you.
All the records shared on GBIF are organized into datasets. Each dataset is associated with some metadata describing its content (the classic &amp;ldquo;what, where, when, why, how&amp;rdquo;). The dataset&amp;rsquo;s content depends strongly on the dataset&amp;rsquo;s class. GBIF currently support four types of dataset:</description>
