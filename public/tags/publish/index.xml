      <title>Making collection content discoverable when you don’t have occurrences published on GBIF</title>
      <link>https://data-blog.gbif.org/post/grscicoll-collection-descriptors/</link>

      <description>This blog post is a tutorial on how to upload collection descriptors in the Global Registry of Scientific Collections (GRSciColl).
If you are someone working with a physical collection or work with people who do, you might be interested in making these collections findable. Ideally, the content of these collections would be digitized and made available online on relevant platforms like GBIF.org, iDigBio.org, ALA.org.au, etc. Sharing digital specimen records is a great way to ensure the discoverability of collection content.</description>

      <title>GBIF attempts to improve identifier stability by monitoring changes of occurrenceIDs</title>
      <link>https://data-blog.gbif.org/post/improve-identifier-stability/</link>

      <description>Since 2022, GBIF has been monitoring changes of occurrenceIDs in datasets to improve the stability of GBIF identifiers. We pause data ingestion when we detect more than half of occurrence records in the latest version have different occurrenceIDs from the previous version (live on GBIF.org). This identifier validation process automatically creates issues on GitHub and GBIF helpdesk will contact the publishers to verify the changes of occurrenceIDs.
Our aim in this process is to minimize the changes of GBIF identifiers and to support the needs for citations and data linking.</description>

      <title>What are the flags &#34;Collection match fuzzy&#34;, &#34;Collection match none&#34;, &#34;Institution match fuzzy&#34;, &#34;Institution match none&#34; and how to remove them?</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;You are a data publisher of occurrence data through GBIF.org, care about your data quality, and wonder what to do about the issue flags that show up on your occurrences. You might have noticed a new type flag this year relating to collection and institution codes and identifiers. They are the result of our attempt at linking specimens records to &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.gbif.org/grscicoll&#34;&gt;our Registry of Scientific Collections (GRSciColl)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Which tools can I use to share my data on GBIF?</title>
      <link>https://data-blog.gbif.org/post/installations-and-hosting-solutions-explained/</link>

      <description>As you probably already know, GBIF.org doesn&amp;rsquo;t host any data. The system relies on each data provider making their data available online in a GBIF-supported format. It also relies on organization letting GBIF know where to find these data (in other words registering the data). But how to do just that?
The good news is that there are several GBIF-compatible systems. They will export or make available the data for you in the correct format and several provide means to register them as datasets on GBIF.</description>

      <title>How to choose a dataset class on GBIF?</title>
      <link>https://data-blog.gbif.org/post/choose-dataset-type/</link>

      <description>If you are a (first time) publisher on GBIF and you are trying to decide which type of dataset would best fit your data, this blogpost is for you.
All the records shared on GBIF are organized into datasets. Each dataset is associated with some metadata describing its content (the classic &amp;ldquo;what, where, when, why, how&amp;rdquo;). The dataset&amp;rsquo;s content depends strongly on the dataset&amp;rsquo;s class. GBIF currently support four types of dataset:</description>

      <title>Sequence-based data on GBIF - Sharing your data</title>
      <link>https://data-blog.gbif.org/post/gbif-molecular-data/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;[Edit 2021-09-16]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Important&lt;/strong&gt;: To find guidance on how to publish Sequence-based data on GBIF, please consult the following guide:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Andersson AF, Bissett A, Finstad AG, Fossøy F, Grosjean M, Hope M, Jeppesen TS, Kõljalg U, Lundin D, Nilsson RN, Prager M, Svenningsen C &amp;amp; Schigel D (2020) Publishing DNA-derived data through biodiversity data platforms. v1.0 Copenhagen: GBIF Secretariat. &lt;a href=&#34;https://doi.org/10.35035/doc-vf1a-nr22&#34;&gt;https://doi.org/10.35035/doc-vf1a-nr22&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[End edit 2021-09-16]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GBIF is trying to make it easier to share sequence-based data. In fact, this past year alone, we worked with &lt;a href=&#34;https://unite.ut.ee&#34;&gt;UNITE&lt;/a&gt; to integrate species hypothesis for fungi and with EMBL-&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ebi.ac.uk&#34;&gt;EBI&lt;/a&gt; to publish 295 metagenomics datasets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, documentation is not as quick to follow. Although we have now an &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.gbif.org/faq?question=how-can-i-publish-molecular-data-to-gbif&#34;&gt;FAQ&lt;/a&gt; on the topic, I thought that anyone could use a blog post with some advice and examples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that this blog post is not intended to be documentation. The information written is subject to change, feel free to leave comments if you have any question or suggestion.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>This blog post covers the publication of multimedia on GBIF. However, it is not intended to be documentation. For more information, please check the references below.
NB: GBIF does not host original multimedia files and there is no way to upload pictures to the platform. For more information, please read the how to publish paragraphs.
Media displayed on the GBIF portal Let&amp;rsquo;s say that you are looking for pictures of otters, or perhaps the call of a sea eagle.</description>
